I completed this project alone.

No Implementation/Application since it's not required.

The "COMP3005 Project Report.pdf" is the Project Report.
The "SQL" directory has all the SQL statements and queries used.

How to create and setup the database:
1. Open pgAdmin4
2. Right click "Databases" and click "Create"
3. Name the database whatever you want and click "Save"
4. Right click the newly created database and click "Query Tool"
5. In the query tab, open the create_tables.ddl file or paste its entire content in
6. Click the "Execute" button, it is shaped like a play button
7. Done
